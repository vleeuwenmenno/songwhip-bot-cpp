# Songwhip Discord bot but rewritten in C++ ([Original](https://github.com/vleeuwenmenno/songwhip-bot))
<a href="https://discordbotlist.com/bots/860899901020700684"><img src="https://discordbotlist.com/api/v1/bots/860899901020700684/widget"></a>

### Please don't use this one!
I wrote this as a test in my abilities to program, this repo is not fully featured like the original C# variant.
Please if you wish to use this bot, use the [C# repository](https://github.com/vleeuwenmenno/songwhip-bot)

A songwhip discord bot that converts your song links to a nice looking embed.
